            </h3></dt>
            <dd>An ensemble classifier method for cervical cancer diagnosis is a machine learning approach that combines multiple individual classifiers to make predictions about whether a patient has cervical cancer or not.The ensemble classifier method takes advantage of the diversity and complementary strengths of different classifiers to improve the overall performance and accuracy of the prediction. Each individual classifier in the ensemble trained independently on a subset of the available data or using different feature
            representations.Therefore,careful experimentation and evaluation are necessary
            to select the most effective ensemble classifier approach for a given cervical
            cancer diagnosis task.</dd>

           <dd> A college library management is a project that manages and stores
            books information electronically according to students needs. The system helps
            both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books
            available in the library. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book.
